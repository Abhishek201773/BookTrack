Book Notes Tracker
The Book Notes Tracker is a web application inspired by Derek Sivers' idea of cataloging and rating books. This project is designed to help you keep track of all the non-fiction books you've read, store your personal notes and ratings, and sort them by recency or rating. It leverages a PostgreSQL database for persistence and uses the Open Library Covers API to fetch book cover images dynamically.
